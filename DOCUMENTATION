# Map format :
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maps in PPARPG are saved in text files that consist of a pickled python dictionary,
with all the data needed to build the map (except for the data related to NPCs).
The keys of such a map dictionary can be :

- name : the full name of the map, as displayed in game
- X : width of the map, in tile units
- Y : height of the map, in tile units
- collision : this contains a list of lists with collision data meant to be fed to the CollisionGrid class on init.
- groundTex : the path to the texture used for the ground
- mipImg : the path to the image to use to create a TerrainGround (mapUtils.py)
- mapObjects : a list of lists containing data about map objects : name(string), genre(string),
pos (Point3),	hpr (Point3), scale(Point3 or float)
- skybox : name (string) of the skybox, to use with SkyBox.load(name) (it's not a path, it's just a name)
- music : the path to the default background music to play on this map
- ambientSound : the path to the ambient sound to play on this map

TODO : handle water, plants, dynamic inner and solid walls and their texture
